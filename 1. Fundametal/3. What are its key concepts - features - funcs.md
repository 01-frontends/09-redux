## Key components of Redux

- Store
  . `A single object` that holds the `entire application state`

- Action
  . `An object` contains `type and payload` properties which will be `send to Reducer`

- Dispatch
  . `A function` which `send an action` to the Redux store

- Reducers
  . `Pure functions` that specify `how the state should change` `base on Action` object

- Middleware (optional)
  . Redux by itself `is synchronous` so we need `middlewares` to `handle asynchronous tasks`
  . Middleware is located `after dispatching an Action` and `before Reducer`
  . Used for `handling side effects`, `asynchronous operations`, or `logging actions`
