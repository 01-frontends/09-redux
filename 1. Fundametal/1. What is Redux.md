## What is Redux

- Redux is a `predictable state management library` for JavaScript applications, commonly used with frameworks like React
- It helps `manage the application's state` in a `central store` and ensures that state changes are predictable and traceable through a unidirectional data flow

## Redux operates on three core principles

- `Single Source of Truth`
  . The `entire application state` is stored in `a single JavaScript object` called the "store."

- `State is Read-Only`
  . The state can `only be changed` by `dispatching "actions,"` which are plain objects describing the change

- `Changes are Made with Pure Functions`
  . To modify the state, a reducer function is used, which takes the current state and action, then returns a new state.
